"","Question"
"1","How do benthic invertebrates (clams and mussels) impact fish benefits from wetlands?"
"2","How much do tidal wetlands export primary and secondary production?"
"3","How does bird and mammal predation impact listed fish populations in wetlands?"
"4","Do wetland benefits scale? So, is a larger site better than a smaller site? Are there edge effects?"
"5","How do floodplains, tidal wetlands, and managed wetlands compare in terms of fish food and habitat production?"
"6","How does fish growth/reproduction compare between tidal wetlands and other habitat types?"
"7","How does form and magnitude of primary production (vegetation, algae, etc) influence secondary production (zoops, macroinvertebrates, etc)?"
"8","How does wetland geomorphology influence wetland benefits to fish?"
"9","How does fish diet change with different amounts of vegetation?"
"10","How do habitat benefits scale with size/inundation (e.g., tidal/managed/floodplain)"
"11"," what ecosystem components may have strongest limiting effect on listed species "
